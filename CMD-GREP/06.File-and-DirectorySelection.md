# 06.File and Directory Selection

-a或--text                             
        grep原本是搜寻文字文件，若拿二进制的档案作为搜寻的目标，则会显示如下的讯息: Binary file 二进制文件名matches 然后结束。
        若加上-a参数则可将二进制档案视为文本文件搜寻，相当于--binary-files=text这个参数。
-R -r, --recursive            
         递归地，读取每个资料夹下的所有档案，此相当于-d recsuse 参数。
-d ACTION, --directories=ACTION   
        若输入的档案是一个资料夹，使用ACTION去处理这个资料夹。预设ACTION是read(读取)，也就是说此资料夹会被视为一般的档案。
　　 若ACTION是skip(略过)，资料夹会被grep略过：
　　 若ACTION是recurse(递归)，grep会去读取资料夹下所有的档案，此相当于-r 参数。
--binary-files=TYPE               
        此参数TYPE预设为binary(二进制)，若以普通方式搜寻，只有2种结果:
　　    1.若有符合的地方：显示Binary file 二进制文件名matches
　　    2.若没有符合的地方：什么都没有显示。
　　    若TYPE为without-match，遇到此参数，grep会认为此二进制档案没有包含任何搜寻样式，与-I 参数相同。
        若TPYE为text， grep会将此二进制文件视为text档案，与-a 参数相同。
　　    Warning: --binary-files=text 若输出为终端机，可能会产生一些不必要的输出。
-I                                
        grep会强制认为此二进制档案没有包含任何搜寻样式，与--binary-files=without-match参数相同。

File and Directory Selection
       -a, --text
              Process a binary file as if it were text; this is equivalent to the --binary-files=text option.

       --binary-files=TYPE
              If  the  first  few  bytes  of a file indicate that the file contains binary data, assume that the file is of type
              TYPE.  By default, TYPE is binary, and grep normally outputs either a one-line message saying that a  binary  file
              matches,  or  no message if there is no match.  If TYPE is without-match, grep assumes that a binary file does not
              match; this is equivalent to the -I option.  If TYPE is text, grep processes a binary file as  if  it  were  text;
              this  is  equivalent  to  the -a option.  Warning: grep --binary-files=text might output binary garbage, which can
              have nasty side effects if the output is a terminal and if the terminal driver interprets some of it as  commands.

       -D ACTION, --devices=ACTION
              If  an  input file is a device, FIFO or socket, use ACTION to process it.  By default, ACTION is read, which means
              that devices are read just as if they were ordinary files.  If ACTION is skip, devices are silently skipped.

       -d ACTION, --directories=ACTION
              If an input file is a directory, use ACTION to  process  it.   By  default,  ACTION  is  read,  which  means  that
              directories  are  read  just as if they were ordinary files.  If ACTION is skip, directories are silently skipped.
              If ACTION is recurse, grep reads all files under each directory, recursively; this is equivalent to the -r option.

       --exclude=GLOB
              Skip  files  whose base name matches GLOB (using wildcard matching).  A file-name glob can use *, ?, and [...]  as
              wildcards, and \ to quote a wildcard or backslash character literally.

       --exclude-from=FILE
              Skip files whose base name matches any of the file-name globs read from FILE (using wildcard matching as described
              under --exclude).

       --exclude-dir=DIR
              Exclude directories matching the pattern DIR from recursive searches.

       -I     Process  a  binary  file as if it did not contain matching data; this is equivalent to the --binary-files=without-
              match option.

       --include=GLOB
              Search only files whose base name matches GLOB (using wildcard matching as described under --exclude).

       -R, -r, --recursive
              Read all files under each directory, recursively; this is equivalent to the -d recurse option.
